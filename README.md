## Using these dotfiles ##
I am using gnu stow to manage my dotfiles

The dotfiles directory should be at ~/dotfiles

Use `stow [directory]` to link dotfiles to the correct location. 
Note: some directories, such as the pacman directory, cannot be stowed into your home foler and be correctly installed
